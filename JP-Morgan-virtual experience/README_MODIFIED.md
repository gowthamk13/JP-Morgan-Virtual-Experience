JP Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Experience — Personal Implementation (Java Focused)

This repository contains my implementation of the J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Software Engineering Virtual Internship completed through the Forage platform.
Although the original internship tasks include multiple technologies, I recreated the concepts using Java, focusing on data processing, dashboards, and real-time feed simulation to strengthen my Java development skills.

// Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how financial firms handle:

Real-time data feeds

Data visualization

Error handling in live systems

Dashboards used by traders

Backend processing logic

I implemented the core logic in Java, including:

Simulating market data streams

Processing and validating incoming data

Creating a Java-based backend to handle stock price updates

Rendering data to a simple UI layer

This helped strengthen my Java fundamentals and apply them in a real financial-engineering use case.

// Key Features (Java Implementation) 
// Real-Time Market Data Simulation (Java)

Generates mock price updates

Parses values using Java classes

Processes feeds using collections and OOP design
// Data Validation & Error Handling

Detects incorrect feed values

Validates open/high/low/close price structures

Logs errors using Java exception handling

// Stock Dashboard Logic

Java code organizes processed data into a presentable form

Backend logic supports UI rendering

Data prepared using custom Java models

// Object-Oriented Architecture

Classes for Stock, PriceFeed, DashboardManager

Encapsulation + modular design

Easy to extend for additional market metrics

// Tech Stack Used

Java (Primary Language)

Java Collections Framework

Exception Handling

File I/O for data storage

Java-based backend logic

(Optional Frontend): HTML/CSS for simple display

// What I Learned
Through this project, I strengthened:

Java OOP concepts (classes, interfaces, abstraction)

Working with dynamic data using collections

Real-time data processing logic

Error handling & debugging

How financial dashboards and data feeds work

Converting real-world requirements into code logic

This project helped me build confidence in using Java in real-world, finance-oriented applications — which is why I mentioned this in my Cognizant application.
